== Description ==

MobilePress is a WordPress plugin that will render your WordPress blog on mobile
handsets, with the ability to use customized themes. Built into MobilePress is the
ability to track your mobile sites analytics and serve ads with [Aduity.com](http://aduity.com).

Integration with [Aduity.com](http://aduity.com) enables you to serve ads from some of the biggest
mobile ad networks such as Admob, Quattro Wireless, Buzzcity and InMobi. You can
also serve you own managed ads. You will also be able to track your visitors every
move with Aduity analytics.

The plugin allows WordPress theme developers to create custom mobile themes for
MobilePress enabled blogs. Theme designers can create specific iPhone themes or
generic mobile themes for other mobile devices.

MobilePress is SEO enabled and detects Google, Yahoo and MSN mobile search bots.
These mobile search engine bots will see the mobile version of your blog and get
your mobile site indexed in the mobile search results.

== Installation ==

Installation instructions available at: [MobilePress.co.za](http://mobilepress.co.za/download/installation)


== Config & Settings ==

Once successfully installed, you will be presented with a few options.

= Blog Title =

Changing this will replace the title of your blog when being viewed on a
mobile device.  So, instead of "My cool blog", you could replace it with
something like "My mobile blog".  This will not affect your site when being
viewed on a regular web browser.

= Blog Description =

This is the same as changing your blog title, but will modify your blog's
description instead.

= Force Mobile Site =

This option will force your site to be rendered as mobile, regardless of where
it is being viewed from. Regular web browsers will see the mobile version.
