This plugin allows you to generate shortlinks for post/pages using URL Shorteners (e.g. Bit.ly, Su.pr, ping.fm, Digg and many others).

== Description ==

*Version 3.1: Now you can generate/display shortlinks directly from posts using the [shortlink] shortcode!*

*Version 3.0 is completely re-written. For those updating from previous versions, please check your settings again.*

[URL Shortener](http://www.fusedthought.com/downloads#url-shortener-wordpress-plugin "URL Shortener") allows you to generate shortlinks for post/pages using URL Shorteners (e.g. Bit.ly, Su.pr, ping.fm, Digg and many others).

Features:

* Automatic generation of a Short URL/Shortlinks
* *Cached Shortlink* - thus generated only once. 
* Choose to generate shortlinks using permalinks or the posts ID (e.g. http://your_site/index.php?p=123).
* Relatively extensive shortlink support
* *Action Hooks available* for other plugins to utilize generated shortlinks (From Version 3.0 Onwards)
* Nice ID links - http://your_site/123 instead of http://your_site/index.php?p=123
* Shortcode support: Place [shortlink] in your article where you want to display the shortened url.
