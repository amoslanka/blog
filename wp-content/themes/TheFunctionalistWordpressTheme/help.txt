// Theme: Minimal and Horizontal
// Creator: Greg Ponchak â€“ http://www.gregponchak.com

// Installation

To install this Wordpress theme, just drag the MinimalAndHorzontal folder into your
"/wp-content/themes/" folder. From there, log into your Wordpress Administration 
and go to Appearance > Themes. Click on the theme titled "Minimal and Horizontal".

Tah dah! You have now successfully installed the theme.

// Twitter Integration
From the Wordpress Administration panel, go to Appearance > Editor. From 
there, click on the link to the right called "Theme Functions". Within this file 
there are two editing options. One is to add your Twitter account to the page. 

To integrate your Twitter account with this theme, spot these lines in the code:

***ENTER YOUR TWITTER ID BETWEEN THE SINGLE QUOTES-----|
                                                       |    */
$TwitterID = 'gregponchak';/* <------------------------|    */

Where it says 'gregponchak', change that to your own Twitter ID and press the 
"Update File" button at the bottom of the page. You are done! And your Twitter
account is now integrated with this theme.

[Alternatively, if you do not want to integrate a Twitter account with this theme,
you can log into your Wordpress Administration and go to Appearance > Editor. From there
scroll down and click the link entitled " Stylesheet (style.css)". Add this line of code 
to the bottom of the file:

#twitter_div { display:none; }
